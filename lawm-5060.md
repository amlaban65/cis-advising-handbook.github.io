Starting Fall 2022, LAWM 5060: Technology, Law & Ethics is an option for satisfying the Engineering Ethics requirement for CSCI, ASCS, NETS and CMPE majors. Because LAWM 5060 is offered by the Law School, there are a few things that work differently from SAS/SEAS/Wharton courses.

### Register for the right section

Only one particular section of LAWM 5060 will satisfy the Engineering Ethics requirement. Check the course description on Path@Penn to see which is the correct one.

### How to register

Please submit a Permission Request on Path@Penn. SEAS students cannot register directly during Advance Registration or Regular Registration.

### Different academic calendar

<!--
Penn Law has its [own academic calendar](https://www.law.upenn.edu/academics/calendar/), with dates that are not always aligned with the general Penn academic calendar. In some years, Law courses start a bit earlier, or end a bit later than the rest of Penn.

The add and drop deadlines are also different. Generally, you can add/drop/swap freely for the first two weeks of the term. The drop and withdraw deadlines follow. Check with your LAWM 5060 instructor to be aware of your semester's particular deadlines.

For Fall 2022, LAWM 5060 operates on the general Penn Academic Calendar, but with a **different Drop deadline** of 13 September.

### No Pass/Fail

While other Engineering Ethics courses can be taken Pass/Fail, the Law School does not allow Pass/Fail grading, so you have to take LAWM 5060 for a grade.

### Credit Hours vs Credit Units

Penn Law courses use *credit hours* instead of the *credit unit* system used by the rest of Penn courses.  A standard Law School course (like LAWM 5060) is 3 *credit hours*, which is equivalent to 1 *credit unit*.
