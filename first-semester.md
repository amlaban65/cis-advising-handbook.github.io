This article discusses how to decide which classes to take in your first year in CIS. For an overview of the mechanics and deadlines of registering for classes, see [this helpful page from the College](https://www.college.upenn.edu/registration-process).

The task of picking the right classes for your first semester can be a bit daunting. You have probably received lots
of advice already - perhaps some suggestions
from your OPA and/or your peers, or you've seen our [sample 4-year schedules]({% link sample-schedule.md %}) - but the reality is that everyone's situation is different. **No single set of 
suggestions can work for every student**, and what worked for your OPA won't necessarily work for you. Perhaps you have 
some AP credit that they did not, or vice versa. Perhaps you love Physics, and they hated it, or vice versa. This is why
we have collected some fairly detailed advice for you below.

Please think about your choices carefully. During your first semester you won't just be taking classes, you'll also be 
adjusting to life in the university, on your own, and in a different city. So it is important not to take on too much, and 
to pick classes that will get you on the right track for the next couple of years.

Here are some questions you should think about before you start picking specific courses:

* **How much Math and Computer Science do you already know?** Depending on the answer, you may be able to skip some
of the lower-level MATH and CIS courses.
* **How much work are the courses you are picking?** If you take on too much, you will have a terrible semester
and won't be able to learn the material well.
* **How confident are you that CIS is for you?** If you are sure, that's great - jump right in! If you aren't
completely sure yet, or if you are Curriculum Deferred but interested in CIS, the advice will be somewhat different.

More about each of these points is below.

## How many courses should I take?

Course load at Penn is measured in _course units_ (CUs); most courses are worth 1 CU, although a few are worth more or less. 
A normal course load is 5 
CUs, but you can take as few as 4 or as many as 5.5. In general, 4 CUs is a good choice for your first semester. You will have a mix of 4 and 5 CU semesters on your way to getting the 37 CUs you need to graduate.

We sometimes get questions from incoming first-year students about taking more than 5.5 CUs. This is such a bad idea that [it is not allowed](https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/undergraduate-policies/course-load/). Dual-degree
students may need to take more than 5 CUs at some point, but the first semester is definitely not the right time.

## Should I start with CIS 1100 or CIS 1200?

We strongly recommend that you take at least one CIS course in your first semester, so you can get started on your major
right away. Typically, this means <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> or <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>. However, the question which one to take is tricky enough that it has
[an entire article of its own]({% link skip-1100.md %}). 
Briefly, if you have little or no prior programming experience, you should start with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>. If you have AP 
credit for <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>, or if you are **very** sure that you already know **all** of the material in <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>, you can start 
with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> and later take some other, higher-level CIS or NETS course to replace <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>.

Both <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> have recitation sections; please don't forget to register for both the lecture _and_ recitation!

## Should I take CIS 1600?

<span class="tooltip">CIS 1600<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 160</span></span> is a course on the mathematical foundations of Computer Science. It is a prerequisite for <span class="tooltip">CIS 1210<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 121</span></span>, which most students take
in either their second or third semester. (The standard sequence of introductory courses is <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>, then <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>, then <span class="tooltip">CIS 1210<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 121</span></span>.)
So, if you have decided to take <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> in your first semester, you should also take <span class="tooltip">CIS 1600<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 160</span></span>, otherwise you will not be able to move
on to <span class="tooltip">CIS 1210<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 121</span></span> and may have to delay some higher-level CIS courses, which tend to require <span class="tooltip">CIS 1210<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 121</span></span>.

Please keep in mind that most students find that <span class="tooltip">CIS 1600<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 160</span></span> is difficult and requires a lot of time and effort; some even say that it 
is the most difficult course they have taken at Penn. This means that, if you do take <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">CIS 1600<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 160</span></span>, you should not take too
many other workload-heavy courses on top of that. 

## Which MATH courses should I take?

Depending on the program you are in, you will need to take at least Calculus I and II, and possibly Calculus III (e.g., if you are 
a NETS student). It is typically a good idea to take one MATH course in your first semester, but the correct choice depends on 
a number of factors:

* The default is to start with <span class="tooltip">MATH 1400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 104</span></span> (Calculus I). There are many different sections available, and you should pick wisely,
e.g., by looking up the instructors' ratings in [Penn Course Review](https://penncoursereview.com), or by asking
other students who have taken these courses before.
* If you have sufficient experience in Calculus, you could take <span class="tooltip">MATH 1410<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 114</span></span>. This is a good idea if you have AP credit for 
<span class="tooltip">MATH 1400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 104</span></span>. Even if not, the MATH department grants retroactive credit for <span class="tooltip">MATH 1400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 104</span></span> if you get a high enough grade in
<span class="tooltip">MATH 1410<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 114</span></span>, or you could take their internal placement exam. Please carefully review the MATH department's [current policies](https://www.math.upenn.edu/undergraduate/advice-new-students/advanced-placement-transfer-retroactive-credit).
* If you love mathematical analysis and are good at it, you could take the honors section of <span class="tooltip">MATH 1410<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 114</span></span>, which is <span class="tooltip">MATH 1610<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 116</span></span>.
This will be significantly more work, but, depending on your preferences, you might enjoy it more.

As with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>, you may hear others recommend that you skip to <span class="tooltip">MATH 1410<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 114</span></span>, or even to <span class="tooltip">MATH 2400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 240</span></span>. Please do not take this advice 
blindly - make the decision based on your own circumstances! For instance, the person who recommended skipping <span class="tooltip">MATH 1400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 104</span></span> 
may have had more mathematical background.

## Should I take Physics?

It is often recommended that you take a natural science course during your first semester - typically <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span>, which is
a requirement for the CIS major, or <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0151<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 151</span></span> (if you have AP credit for <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span>). This can be a good idea if a) you love 
Physics and would enjoy the course, or if b) you are not sure yet that Computer Science is for you. The reason is that many
other SEAS majors also require Physics, so, if you decide to switch majors during your first year, your Physics courses will
count for your new major as well. Note also that <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span> has <span class="tooltip">MATH 1400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 104</span></span> as a co-requisite (you need to have already taken <span class="tooltip">MATH 1400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 104</span></span> or otherwise gotten credit for it, or you need to take <span class="tooltip">MATH 1400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 104</span></span> at the same time as <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span>). <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0151<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 151</span></span> has <span class="tooltip">MATH 1410<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 114</span></span> as a co-req.

In most other cases, you may want to postpone Physics until later. The reason is that <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0151<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 151</span></span> take a substantial amount
of time each week, which is particularly problematic if you are planning to take other "heavy" courses (e.g., <span class="tooltip">CIS 1600<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 160</span></span>) 
at the same time. Even if you do not take <span class="tooltip">CIS 1600<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 160</span></span>, it is usually a good idea to keep your first semester on the lighter side, because you will
still be adjusting to life at Penn, and because you are still learning how to calibrate the difficulty of college classes. So it may be a better idea to focus on your MATH and CIS courses initially.

The course numbering can be a source of confusion. <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span> is the same as <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0140<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 140</span></span>, except that it includes a half-CU lab. Similarly, 
<span class="tooltip">PHYS 0151<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 151</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0141<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 141</span></span> are the same but the former includes a lab. In SEAS, you need to take the versions with the lab (<span class="tooltip">0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span>/<span class="tooltip">0151<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 151</span></span>).
<span class="tooltip">PHYS 0170<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 170</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0171<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 171</span></span> are honors versions of <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0151<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 151</span></span>, and they will count towards the <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span>/<span class="tooltip">0151<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 151</span></span> requirement
as well. If you are very adept at Physics, you should consider the honors versions.

## What else should I take?

To counterbalance the technical courses above, you may want to take one or two non-technical electives as well, such as a first-year
seminar, a writing course, or a humanities or social science course. Many of these will satisfy requirements for your major, which you can read more about [in another article]({% link degree-requirements.md %}). If you expect to have a fairly heavy workload, you can usually find courses that are not so difficult. 
You may also want to take at least one small class, to counterbalance the larger lecture classes, which are somewhat different
from the more conversation-oriented classes you took in high school.

Always check out the course quality and difficulty ratings at [Penn Course Review](https://penncoursereview.com) to get an idea of what you're in for.

## Can I take some Technical Electives?

In general, this is not a good idea for your first semester. The Technical Electives are supposed to be advanced courses
that give you depth, and, as a first-year, you will not have the necessary prerequisites.

## What if I am still not sure what to take?

If you still have questions, please contact [your academic advisor]({% link advisor-meeting.md %}) or [talk with the CIS Advising staff]({{page.links.cis_adv_home}}). We're always happy to talk through your plans!
